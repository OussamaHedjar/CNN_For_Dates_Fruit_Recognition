# CNN_For_Dates_Fruit_Recognition


This project targted learning to build a CNN model which shall be able to recognize dates images and classify them.
I am aware that there are thousands of models out there, yet this was a project I was given to do during my bachelor's studies for Machine Learning course,
 and I wanted to challenge myself and try to build a full model based on my background and a number of attempts.

Since this project was a BCs project, I was also given an example to follow in case I was lost, link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification

Another thing to mention that the data I collected was already sperated to :

1.Training set.
2.Testing set.
